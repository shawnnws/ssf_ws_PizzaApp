NotEmpty VS NotBlank
- NotEmpty just means the length of the field cannot be 0. Whitespaces are counted as elements of the String hence inputting Whitespaces
  will not count as empty.
- NotBlank means the field cannot be of length 0, and must contain at least 1 character other than whitespaces as well.
